- `pytorch 1.5.1` doesn't seem to exist anymore. You can do the following:
```
conda config --add channels conda-forge
conda config --set channel_priority strict
conda create --name neuralpk python=3.7.5
conda activate neuralpk
conda install pytorch==1.5 scipy==1.7.3 torchdiffeq==0.2.2 pandas==1.3.5 scikit-learn==1.0.2 jupyterlab tqdm
``` 
- For now, just using CPU but will need to figure out GPU stuff at the end.
- We fixed a bunch of bugs when adapting this code...
